							LoLRandomizer version 1.1
							  coded by mJrA & xQyz
													
About the Program
=================

LoLRandomizer was designed for the Game League of Legends. We wanted to have more "fun" while playing with friends in normal mode. 
At this time this plugin can roll a random position for each role in 5v5 and in 3v3. As an addition you can get your champion 
rolled, too.

													
Features
=========
- Roll a role (Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support)
- Roll a champion (for each role a common used champion for that role for example u wont get a sona for top)
- Champions for each role can be easy edited by adding them into the .TXT of the role (for example Top.txt)
- Champion images as emoticons (NOTE: this only works if u have IconPack activated)

													
Installation
============

To install the Plugin simply double click the .TS3_plugin file.

IMPORTANT: U need "Lua Plugin" enabled. (you can open the plugin menü by using either the ctrl + shift + p keys, or u can go 
to settings -> Plugins. Make sure the Lua Plugin is checked. Please make sure, that the LoLRandomizer plugin is checked. Do
this by marking the Luaplugin and then go to settings and check the LoLRandomizer.

NOTE: If u use another design copy the emoticons folder into your design.

												
Usage
=====
Type in chat (without ""):
"(start)" - This will reset and start the script

"(p3)"	- 3on3 positions
"(p3c)" - 3on3 positions with champions
"(p5)"	- 5on5 positions
"(p5c)" - 5on5 positions with champions

Note: Only one user should have the plugin activated, otherwise u will get more then one output. The IconPack should be installed by all users otherwise you wont see any champion images.

													
Deinstallation
===============

Delete the LoLRandomizer folder in "C:\Program Files\TeamSpeak 3 Client\plugins\lua_plugin\"
